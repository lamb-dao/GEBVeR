* crossValidate

Purpose: Performs genomic prediction using various methods and
cross-validation, comparing their predictive abilities for a given phenotypic
trait using genotype data. The program provides a comprehensive analysis of
genomic prediction methods for the given dataset, allowing researchers to
compare and select the most suitable approach for their breeding program.

Requirements:
- R environment with packages: BWGS, vcfR, sys
- Input directory containing:
  - Uncompressed .vcf genotype files
  - CSV file with phenotype data (BLUE/BLUP values)

Usage:
1. Set working directory
2. Interactively select input files when prompted
3. Select column with genotypes
4. select the set of methods you will cross validate
5. Run the loop to calculate individual model results
6. Run the loop to collect and compare results

Function:
1. Sets up directory structure
2. Loads and processes genotype and phenotype data
3. Performs cross-validation using multiple user selected genomic prediction methods
4. Calculates predictive abilities and standard deviations for each method
5. Visualizes results through boxplots and bar plots

Output:
- CVcomparison.pdf: Boxplot comparing predictive abilities of methods
- CVdeviation.pdf: Bar plot of standard deviations for each method
- Summary.txt: Text file with summary statistics for all methods
- User may select a specific model for the following
- SummaryGBLUP.txt: Detailed summary for GBLUP method
- Summary_BA_BC_BL.txt: Detailed summaries for BA, BC, and BL methods
- Workspace image saved as "statePostCV" in data directory

* gtMetric

Purpose: Evaluates the accuracy of genomic prediction models by comparing
predicted trait values against ground truth data for multiple traits. This
program provides a comprehensive analysis of genomic prediction accuracy,
suitable for evaluating and comparing different prediction models in plant
breeding programs.

Requirements:
- R environment with required packages (pacman, openxlsx, sys, glue, tidyr,
  recometrics, Hmisc, corrplot, ggplot2, gridExtra)
- Input directory structure with ground truth, phenotype, and prediction CSV files
- A detailed input file specification and expected directory structure is found in the comments


Usage:
1. Set up the input directory structure as specified in the script comments.
2. Set the working directory
3. Follow user prompts
   1. If necessary, rename columns in ground truth file to match
   2. Select genotype column
   3. Select trait columns to process
4. Evaluate metric and utility functions
5. Run the loop to process all matched predictions

Function:
1. Loads and processes input files (ground truth, phenotype, predictions).
2. Reports expected column matches
3. Aligns data across files, matching genotypes and traits.
4. Calculates various statistical metrics (correlation, MSE, RMSE, etc.).
5. Generates visualizations (scatter plots, Bland-Altman plots, histograms).
6. Performs analysis for each selected trait with a matching prediction file.

Output:
For each analyzed trait, the program generates:
1. CSV file with true and predicted values
2. Text file with statistical metrics
3. PDF file with multiple plots (scatter, Bland-Altman, histogram, agreement matrix)
4. All output files are organized in trait-specific subdirectories within the 'output' folder.

* phenoCorrelation

Work In Progress

Purpose: To analyze and compare intra and inter trait correlation of phenotypic
data from two sources (training and validation) for multiple traits, generating
statistical metrics and visualizations.

Requirements:
- R environment with current version
- Required R packages: pacman, openxlsx, sys, glue, tidyr, recometrics, Hmisc, corrplot, ggplot2, gridExtra
- Input CSV files: training phenotype file and ground truth phenotype file
- A detailed input file specification and expected directory structure is found in the comments

Usage:
1. Set working directory
2. Read the script
3. Select input CSV files when prompted
4. Specify trait columns and genotype column when prompted

Function:
1. Imports and preprocesses phenotypic data from two sources
2. Identifies matching traits between datasets
3. For each trait:
   - Aligns data by genotype
   - Calculates various statistical metrics (correlation, performance metrics)
   - Generates visualizations (scatter plots, Bland-Altman plots, histograms, agreement matrices)
   - Writes results to files

Output:
For each trait, in separate directories:
1. CSV file with true and predicted values
2. Text file with statistical metrics
3. PDF file with four plots:
   - Scatter plot of true vs predicted values
   - Bland-Altman plot
   - Histogram of differences
   - Agreement matrix

Output files are organized in the "output" directory, with subdirectories for each trait.
